### **Disclaimer**
This is my first Visual Studio Code for LInux application written in a ChromeOS chroot environment.  I have extensive previous experience with Visual Studio, however my chromebook is my only current build machine.  While not the best or most efficient way to demonstrate my coding skills, I understand that this exercise is more focused on seeing **how** I think through the coding process.

With that said, I have begun this webapi utilizing a [Microsoft Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio-code "Tutorial: Create a web API with ASP.NET Core") to build from.  I believe this provided a quick start for success in this situation, however this may result in remnants of the sample project from the tutorial due to time constraints.
